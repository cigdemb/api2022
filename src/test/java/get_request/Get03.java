        /*
        Note 1: When you execute assertions, Java stops execution just after the first failure,
        it means assertions after the failure were not executed. If assertions were not executed,
        you cannot tell anything about their states. They may pass or they may fail.
        But the assertions before failure were passed, because assertions before failure were executed.

        Note 2: If you type your code as execution will stop in the first failure,
        this is called "Hard Assertion"(Assertion)

        Note 3: If you type your code as execution will not stop in any failure,
        this is called "Soft Assertion"(Verification)

        Note 4: If you use multiple "body()" method it will work like "Hard Assertion",
        if you use just a single "body()" method with multiple assertions in it,
        it will work like "Soft Assertion"
